# Matrix RF Bridge

## Overview

The Matrix RF Bridge is a Python-based tool that uploads recordings from an `RTLSDR-Airband` instance (running in multichannel mode) to a Matrix server (e.g., Synapse). Each frequency is mapped to its own room within a Matrix space, allowing users to browse and listen to recordings via a Matrix client like Element. The project leverages `RTLSDR-Airband` for radio monitoring and `matrix-nio` for Matrix interactions, all running within Docker containers for easy deployment.

This could be used to monitor ATC audio or amateur radio transmissions (the repeater output and FM simplex frequencies of the North American 2 meter band plan fit nicely within the bandwidth of an RTL-SDR).

### Features

- **Multi-Frequency Monitoring**: Monitors multiple frequencies within the SDRâ€™s bandwidth simultaneously (`RTLSDR-Airband` multichannel mode). It is not currently compatible with scan mode, due to the way it parses the `RTLSDR-Airband` config file to get channels.
- **Automatic Recording**: Records transmissions into `.mp3` files when squelch is opened, with filenames including the frequency in Hz.
- **Matrix Integration**: Uploads recordings to dedicated Matrix rooms, organized by frequency.
- **Configurable**: Uses an `rtl_airband.conf` file to define channels, with optional skipping of disabled channels via an environment variable.
- **Dockerized**: Runs in Docker containers, accessing the SDR via pass through.

## What It Does

This tool relies on `RTLSDR-Airband` for all demodulation and recording. These recordings are uploaded to a Matrix server, where each frequency has its own room (e.g., `#145.145MHz:yourdomain.com`). Users can access these rooms using a Matrix client like Element to listen to the recordings.

## Requirements

### Hardware

- SDR supported by `RTLSDR-Airband`.
- Computer or server with access to the SDR and network connectivity.

### Software

- **Operating System**: Linux (recommended), macOS, or Windows (with Docker Desktop).
- **Docker**: Docker and Docker Compose for containerized deployment.
- **Python**: Python 3.9+ (if running outside Docker).

### Dependencies

- **Matrix Server**: A running Synapse server (or another Matrix homeserver) with a registered bot user.
- **Libraries** (installed via Docker):
  - `matrix-nio`: For Matrix interactions.
  - `watchdog`: For filesystem monitoring.
  - `RTLSDR-Airband`: For RTL-SDR frequency monitoring and recording.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Docker**:
   - See instructions at [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. **Set Up Synapse**:
   - Follow the [Synapse installation guide](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/setup/installation.html).
   - Register a bot user: `register_new_matrix_user -u bot_user -p <password> -a -c /path/to/homeserver.yaml`.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seanauff/matrix-rf-bridge.git
cd matrix-rf-bridge
```

## Build Instructions

1. **Prepare Configuration**:
   - Copy the example `rtl_airband.conf` to the `rtl_airband` directory:
     ```bash
     cp example_rtl_airband.conf rtl_airband/rtl_airband.conf
     ```
   - Edit `rtl_airband/rtl_airband.conf` to specify your frequencies (e.g., `freq = 145.145;`).
2. **Create Docker Compose File**:
